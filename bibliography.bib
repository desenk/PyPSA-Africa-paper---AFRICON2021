  abstract = {SG (Smart Grids) are emerging as a very promising technology with buildings as one of its most critical components. SG are meant to leverage energy-efficiency and promote green usage via efficient renewable energy integration. SG pose inherent challenges stemming, mainly, from its inter-disciplinary nature. Besides ICT (Information and Communication Technology), SG involves two other broad disciplines: 1. Power systems and 2. Control systems. Still, ICT is the major component that manifests SG `` Smartness''. In this work, we present the architecture of a real-world smart micro-grid testbed to be deployed in a university campus. We highlight its main components with an emphasis on the ICT component. We are advocating that SG will utilize Internet of Things (IoT) to source all types of data, and thus making the whole system fall within the realm of Big Data. To handle the huge amount of data that will be collected, we advise the deployment of a private local Cloud using open source platform for HPC (High-Performance-Computing) along with Hadoop/MapReduce as the underlying data storage and processing model. We deem this project as an ideal blueprint that can be easily adopted for similar real-world smart micro-grid testbeds in Africa and around the world.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an Agent-Based Model that determines the minimum cost strategy for rural electrification delivery systems and associated decentralized generation focusing entirely on renewable resources. The model creates generalized scenarios examining stakeholders' preferences for renewable resources to deploy and preferences between centralized and decentralized generation. Literature suggests that low demand, topographical challenges and distance from the grid are the main drivers for decentralized generation. This work shows that available energy potential is an important driver as well by introducing the concepts of stress (the percentage of renewable energy potential taken up by demand) and centrality (the ratio between size of resources and average distance to demand) and demonstrating that these parameters influence the minimum cost strategy despite distance and demand. At very low stress levels the lowest cost networks result from emphasizing decentralized generation. At stress levels above 2\%, least cost delivery systems result from emphasizing grid extension of clusters created around resources with high centrality and the decentralized mix is high due to the geographical limitations of renewables. Results show that in every case, while deploying renewable energy for rural electrification, a mixture of grid extension and decentralized generation coexist for universal electrification in the least cost strategies.},

In this study we built a machine-learning model that demonstrates high accuracy in predicting power-generation project failure and success using the largest dataset on historic and planned power plants available for Africa, combined with country-level characteristics. We found that the most relevant factors for successful commissioning of past projects are at plant level: capacity, fuel, ownership and connection type. We applied the trained model to predict the realization of the current project pipeline. Contrary to rapid transition scenarios, our results show that the share of non-hydro renewables in electricity generation is likely to remain below 10\% in 2030, despite total generation more than doubling. These findings point to high carbon lock-in risks for Africa, unless a rapid decarbonization shock occurs leading to large-scale cancellation of the fossil fuel plants currently in the pipeline.},

Here, integration and the optimal use of various available energy resources in a stand-alone microgrid are investigated. An integrated renewable energy system (IRES) approach has been proposed and analyzed using homer software. Seven scenarios with different combinations of energy sources and storage systems have been investigated based on their levelized cost of energy (LCOE) supply and net present cost (NPC). The proposed IRES, which includes photovoltaic (PV), wind, and biogas, gives the least LCOE as \$0.207/kW h without any policy intervention. This LCOE reduces to \$0.12/kW h with policy intervention and consideration of carbon abetment cost. Moreover, sensitivity analysis has been carried out with variation in load, solar radiation, and wind speed. The NPC is found to be most sensitive to the variation of load and least sensitive to the variation of wind speed.},

  abstract = {Reliable access to electricity still remains a challenge in many regions of Nigeria. For achieving a rapid electricity access for large geographic regions alternative electrification pathways apart from grid connection need to be taken into account. Therefore, sophisticated planning tools to determine techno-economic optimized electrification pathways are necessary. Here, an approach for such a tool is presented and combines GIS and energy system simulation tools. The approach is based on the identification of consumer clusters, determination of status of electrification and assignment of a suitable electricity supply option. Three options are taken into account: Grid extension, PV-hybrid mini-grids and solar-home systems (SHS). Within this study we have identified 47,489 consumer clusters for entire Nigeria and found that 46\% of the people living in these clusters are currently not supplied with electricity. A connection of all customers within a 20km zone around the existing grid would have the largest impact with delivering electricity to 57.1 million people. Outside this grid zone, a population of 12.8 million is most suitably supplied by PV-hybrid mini-grids and 2.8 million by SHS. Therefore, a PV capacity in a range of 671 to 1,790 MW for mini-grids and 84 MW for SHS would be required.},

Despite long-standing efforts to scale-up electrification levels, overall progress remains slow and highly cost-ineffective. Hence, it is crucial that electricity planning processes primarily address the questions of the complementarity between utility-scale and decentralised generation. This paper applies the Open Source Spatial Electrification Tool (OnSSET) to two ECOWAS countries \textendash{} Burkina Faso and C\^ote d'Ivoire \textendash{} with the aim of determining the optimal combination of grid-connected and off-grid systems to serve rural and urban demand by 2030, using high-resolution geospatial data. This country-wide analysis highlights the fundamental role of off-grid solar photovoltaics and wind technologies in bridging the electricity access gap, particularly in Burkina Faso. Additionally, cheaper electricity costs in C\^ote d'Ivoire could be taken advantage of through enhanced cross-border exchanges between the two countries.},

While the availability of open power plant databases increased in recent years, they often differ considerably from each other and their data quality has not been systematically compared to proprietary sources yet. Here, we introduce the python-based `powerplantmatching' (PPM), an open source toolset for cleaning, standardizing and combining multiple power plant databases. We apply it once only with open databases and once with an additional proprietary database in order to discuss and elaborate the issue of data quality, by analysing capacities, countries, fuel types, geographic coordinates and commissioning years for conventional power plants. We find that a derived dataset purely based on open data is not yet on a par with one in which a proprietary database has been added to the matching, even though the statistical values for capacity matched to a large degree with both datasets. When commissioning years are needed for modelling purposes in the final dataset, the proprietary database helps crucially to increase the quality of the derived dataset.},

Such settlements often lack basic services, such as electricity. As a result, informal settlement dwellers turn to hazardous alternative sources of energy, such as illegal electricity connections and paraffin. Solar power is a clean and safe alternative. However, informal settlements are often located on undesirable land on the urban fringe where the topography may hinder the use of solar energy. The high density of dwellings could also be a hindrance. Therefore, the solar potential needs to be assessed before any implementations are planned. Solar potential assessment functionality is generally available in geographic information system (GIS) products. The nature, cost and accessibility of datasets required for the assessment vary significantly. In this paper, we evaluate the results of solar potential assessments using GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) for a number of different datasets. The assessments were done for two informal settlements in the City of Tshwane (South Africa): Alaska, which is nestled on a hill; and Phomolong, a densely populated settlement with a rather flat topography. The results show that solar potential assessments with open source GIS software and freely available data are feasible. This eliminates the need for lengthy and bureaucratic procurement processes and reduces the financial costs of assessing solar potential for informal settlements.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Next, we explain how new development efforts will build on the existing OSeMOSYS codebase.

  abstract = {Energy system models are increasingly being used to explore scenarios with large shares of variable renewables. This requires input data of high spatial and temporal resolution and places a considerable preprocessing burden on the modeling team. Here we present a new code set with an open source license for automatic generation of input data for large-scale energy system models for arbitrary regions of the world, including sub-national regions, along with an associated generic capacity expansion model of the electricity system. We use ECMWF ERA5 global reanalysis data along with other public geospatial datasets to generate detailed supply curves and hourly capacity factors for solar photovoltaic power, concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind power, and existing and future hydropower. Further, we use a machine learning approach to generate synthetic hourly electricity demand series that describe current demand, which we extend to future years using regional SSP scenarios. Finally, our code set automatically generates costs and losses for HVDC interconnections between neighboring regions. The usefulness of our approach is demonstrated by several different case studies based on input data generated by our code. We show that our model runs of a future European electricity system with high share of renewables are in line with results from more detailed models, despite our use of global datasets and synthetic demand.},

  abstract = {Access to clean and affordable modern energy is crucial to fostering social and economic development and to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Efficient policy frameworks and effective electrification programs are required in order to ensure that people are electrified in a sustainable manner. These programs differ from country to country depending on geographic and socioeconomic conditions. Electrification planning process must consider the geographical characteristics of the resources as well as the spatial dimension of social and economic drivers of energy demand in order to find the most optimal energy access solution. Geographical theory and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in particular can play a significant role in electrification planning, since they are capable of managing the data needed in the decision making process and may integrate and assess all possible options. This paper focuses on considering these characteristics by applying a recently developed GIS based methodology to inform electrification planning and strategies in Ethiopia. The paper illustrates two major aspects of energy planning; 1.) how the optimal electrification mix is influenced by a range of parameters \textendash{} including population density, existing and planned transmission networks and power plants, economic activities, tariffs for grid-based electricity, technology costs for mini-grid and off-grid systems, and fuel costs for consumers and 2.) how the electrification mix differs from location to location. For a certain level of energy access, on-grid connections would be optimal for the majority of the new connections in Ethiopia; grid extension constitutes the lowest cost option for approximately 93\% of the newly electrified population in this modelling effort with 2030 as time horizon. However, there are some remote areas with low population density where a mini-grid (ca. 6\%) or a stand-alone solution (ca. 1\%) are the most economic options. Depending on local resource availability, these systems deploy varied combinations of solar, wind, hydro and diesel technologies.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, more than 620 million people in Africa live without access to electricity. Nowhere in the world is the chasm between available energy resources and access to electricity greater than on the African continent. With the exception of conventional hydropower, the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix remains insignificant, despite the considerable untapped renewable energy potential in the region. A critical issue in the development of renewable energy sources is the cost, which is a function of the resource availability, the geographic and topological characteristics of a studied area as well as the selected energy conversion technologies. This paper applies a detailed Geographic Information Systems (GIS) approach in order to identify the cost of generating electricity using onshore wind turbines considering several localization criteria. The levelized cost of wind generated electricity is calculated geospatially and shall be used as an indicator to compare different suitable sites at the pre-feasibility stage. The levelized cost of generating electricity varies between 0.04 and 0.17 USD/kWh, placing wind power in a cost competitive position in the electricity market of the continental countries.},

Despite this, vast amounts of renewable energy resources are geographically distributed across the region. SSA needs to establish proper planning mechanisms if it is to achieve universal access while mitigating Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission. This paper presents a scoping review of 30 integrated energy modeling studies that concern SSA. The review indicates that addressing the region's energy access challenges will require decentralized generation and grid extension to be employed in a synergistic way. Achieving high access levels while limiting GHG emissions will require energy decision makers to enact and implement climate, techno-economic, environmental, and efficiency policies. Additionally, technology learning and energy storage will improve the uptake of variable renewable resources. Operationalization of power trade will reduce the capital investment costs required to meet the current and future energy demand and tap into potential of the abundant renewable energy resources in SSA region. Energy planning using an integrated energy systems model will be key to achieving these aims at national as well as regional level. Accordingly, it is necessary that national governments and energy decision makers in the region work in tandem with energy stakeholders, local academic institutions, and international energy modeling experts to build local capacities. This will then enable a synchronized framework for the development of short-to medium-term national energy models, the results of which could then be integrated into a regional model.},

Countries wherein budgets are constrained and institutions stressed are faced with the challenge of further extending energy services \textendash{} and doing so significantly. To meet this goal for the power sector in a cost-effective way, governments have to consider the deployment of a mix of stand-alone, mini-grid and grid-based solutions. To help inform analysis, planning and the decision process, this paper presents a simple, transparent, least-cost model for the electrification of rural areas. The approach builds on four key parameters, namely: (i) target level and quality of energy access, (ii) population density, (iii) local grid connection characteristics and (iv) local energy resources availability and technology cost. From an application perspective, this work can be used both for (1) fast assessments of specific energy access projects, and (2) to inform more complex regional studies using a geo-referencing software to analyze the results. Such applications are presented in the results using country case studies developed for Nigeria and Ethiopia. These show how the strategy for expanding energy access may vary significantly both between and within given regions of energy-poor countries.},

Traditional ways to improve storage technologies are to reduce their costs; however, the cheapest energy storage is not always the most valuable in energy systems. This paper reviews techno-economic storage valuation methods and expands them by the new "market potential method" which derives a system-value by examining the capacities obtained from a long-term investment planning optimisation. We apply and compare this method to other cost metrics in a renewables-based European power system model, covering diverse energy storage technologies. We find that characteristics of high-cost hydrogen storage can be equally or even more valuable than low-cost hydrogen storage. Additionally, we show that modifying the freedom of storage sizing and component interactions can make the energy system 10\% cheaper and impact the value of technologies. The results suggest to look beyond the pure cost reduction paradigm and focus on developing technologies with value approaches that can lead to cheaper electricity systems in future. One practical and useful value method to guide energy storage innovation could be the market potential method.},

We here compare CSP (concentrating solar power) and nuclear power as baseload electricity providers for the case of South Africa, which is adding significant new generation capacity, has an abundant solar resource, but also one existing and additional planned nuclear power plants. Both of these technologies are considered baseload-capable with sufficient available fuel (sunlight or fissible material) to provide large amounts of nearly emissions-free electricity. We find that under a range of technological learning assumptions, CSP compares favorably against nuclear on costs in the period to 2030, and has lower investment and environmental risks. The results suggest that while nuclear power may be an important low-emissions power technology in regions with little sun, in the case of South Africa, CSP could be capable of providing a stable baseload supply at lower cost than nuclear power, and may have other non-cost benefits.},

Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. Flexibility from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P2G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make a significant contribution to the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs. The cost-minimising integration of BEV pairs well with the daily variations of solar power, while P2G and LTES balance the synoptic and seasonal variations of demand and renewables. In all scenarios, an expansion of cross-border transmission reduces system costs, but the more tightly the energy sectors are coupled, the weaker the benefit of transmission reinforcement becomes.},

The modelled structure provides the first quantitative step in the research committed to develop an appropriate modelling framework for deriving policy insights regarding the electricity-development nexus and the evolution of electricity demand for rural areas of developing countries. The simulation results show and highlight the dynamics behind the structural behaviour of some socio-economic system variables (e.g. income and IGAs growth), the exogenous determinants (e.g. accessibility of the rural village), and the complementary activities (e.g. micro-credit at electricity access) that allow electricity access to foster local socio-economic changes, which in turn supports the growth of electricity demand. Our findings allow increasing the understanding on the complex electricity-development nexus and providing a novel modelling framework for projecting the electricity demand for rural settings.},

The study relies on an improved model grounded on the OSeMOSYS framework. GIS data are used both to determine the electricity demand projections and to inform the decision about the optimal production technologies made by OSeMOSYS with a least-cost criterion. Findings indicate that the stated policy goals (New Policy scenario) are within reach, but they also imply an increase in installed capacity from less than 2~GW to at least 13.8~GW, corresponding to an investment of 25.3 billion USD, which is significantly above historical spending in the power sector. Also, only an additional environmental policy (450TZ scenario) would ensure that the carbon intensity of the power sector lowers from a current 440 gCO2/kWh to around 100 gCO2/kWh in 2040, with the additional benefit of a lower average cost of providing electricity (compared to the New Policy scenario). An Energy For All scenario where universal access is achieved two decades earlier (in 2030) is also feasible but implies more difficulties in lowering carbon intensity or the cost of providing electricity. Results for universal access are the object of a separate in-depth discussion and a sensitivity analysis looks at the effect of key assumption (e.g., on demand projections and discount rate) on the main results.},

  abstract = {Pioneering approaches are needed to accelerate universal access to electricity while simultaneously transitioning to reliable, sustainable and affordable energy systems. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the challenges lie in attracting the private sector to complement public investments. Here, we present an integrated `low-hanging-fruit' approach aimed at boosting private investment and speeding up the deployment of renewable energy systems in SSA. We analyse the potential of existing energy infrastructure, where a significant upfront investment has already been made, to be exploited for electricity generation. We develop a comprehensive methodology to identify and select suitable locations in SSA and estimate their potential for exploitation. These locations have been further analysed in terms of power capacity potential, electricity output, investments needed and population to be benefited. This strategy to attract additional finance can easily be reproduced, engaging private investors while simultaneously helping to achieve the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals on energy.},

  abstract = {Africa is a resource-rich continent but lacks the required power infrastructure. Efforts such as the United Nations Sustainable Energy for All and U.S. President Obama's Power Africa initiatives aim to facilitate much needed investment. However, no systematic national and regional investment outlook is available to analysts. This paper examines indicative scenarios of power plant investments based on potential for electricity trade. OSeMOSYS, a cost-optimization tool for long-term energy planning, is used to develop least cost system configurations. The electricity supply systems of forty-seven countries are modelled individually and linked via trade links to form TEMBA (The Electricity Model Base for Africa). A scenario comparison up to 2040 shows that an enhanced grid network can alter Africa's generation mix and reduce electricity generation cost. The insights have important investment, trade and policy implications, as specific projects can be identified as of major significance, and thus receive political support and funding.},

  abstract = {While electricity access is lowest in developing countries, the academic literature on generation expansion planning (GEP) has been informed almost exclusively by challenges in industrialised countries. This paper presents the first multi-objective, long-term energy planning optimisation model tailored towards national power systems with little existing power infrastructure. It determines the location, type, capacity and timing of power system infrastructure additions. Specifically, three novel generalisations of standard generation planning are introduced: (1) an expansion of the demand constraints to allow for industrial and household electrification rates below 100\%, (2) a minimisation of sub-national energy access inequality in conjunction with minimising system costs considering environmental constraints, and (3) an integration of distribution infrastructure, explicitly including both on-grid and off-grid electrification. Using a specifically designed solution algorithm based on the {$\epsilon$}-constraint method, the model was successfully applied to the previously unexplored Ugandan national power system case. The results suggest that while it is cost-optimal to maintain highly unequal sub-national access patterns to meet Uganda's official 80\% electrification target in 2040, equal access rates across all districts can be achieved by increasing discounted system cost by only 3\%. High optimal shares of locationally flexible on-grid and off-grid solar energy enable cheap sub-national shifts of generation capapcity. This paper strongly challenges the Ugandan government's nuclear energy and largely grid-based electrification expansion plans. Instead, it calls for solar concentrated power as a baseload option in the future and a focus on off-grid electrification which the model selects for the majority of household connections in 2040, even in a high-demand scenario.},

  abstract = {Current urban water and energy systems are expanding while increasing attention is paid to their social, economic and environmental impacts. As a research contribution that can support real-world decision making and transitions to sustainable cities and communities, we have built a model-based and data-driven platform combining comprehensive database, agent-based simulation and resource technology network optimization for system level water and energy planning. Several use cases are demonstrated based on the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA) city-region in Ghana, as part of the Future Cities Africa (FCA) project. The outputs depict an overall resource landscape of the studied urban area, but also provide the energy, water, and other resource balance of supply and demand from both macro and micro perspectives, which is used to propose environmental friendly and cost effective sustainable city development strategies. This work is to become a core component of the resilience.io platform as an open-source integrated systematic tool gathering social, environmental and economic data to inform urban planning, investment and policy-making for city-regions globally.},
